# Identifying Trends in Customer Ratings
The purpose of this project was to explore the possible correlation between word choice and star rating in Yelp reviews - i.e. when a customer reviews a restaurant, can we identify if each star rating has keywords associated with it? Does a five star rating praise fast service? Does a one star rating emphasize a long wait time? What about food quality?
We decided to analyze this correlation in two different types of restaurants (Italian vs. Chinese) to see if this correlation existed in more than one dataset, and if Yelp users looked for similar or differing qualities depending on the type of restaurant visited.
